### Kubernetes cronjob
Kubernetes cronjobs are fundamentally the same as linux cronjobs that can be deployed with Kubernetes manifests. They perform actions on a schedule denoted by the contab syntax. [Crontab Guru](https://crontab.guru/) is a great resource for getting the cron schedule you want.  

Like every other object in Kubernetes, you declare your cronjob in a manifest and then submit it to the API server using `kubectl apply -f <cronjob_name>.yaml`. When creating a cronjob, you must specify what container image you want your cronjob to run inside of. 

```yaml
# Modified From https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: anacronda
spec:
  schedule: "* * * * *" # This means run every 60 seconds
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: anacronda 
            image: busybox:1.28
            imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
            command:
            - /bin/sh
            - -c
            - date; echo Hello from the Kubernetes cluster
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

## Attack Vectors

1. **Malicious Container Images:**
    * **Compromised Images:** Attackers can inject malicious code into container images used in CronJobs. If these images are pulled from untrusted registries or lack proper security scanning, they can compromise the entire pod and potentially the cluster.
    * **Supply Chain Attacks:** Targeting the supply chain of container images, attackers can compromise base images or inject malicious code during the build process, affecting all CronJobs relying on those images.

2. **Exploiting CronJob Permissions:**
    * **Excessive Permissions:** CronJobs running with excessive permissions (e.g., root privileges) can allow attackers to access sensitive resources, modify files on the host, or even escalate privileges within the cluster.
    * **RBAC Misconfigurations:** Weak or misconfigured Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies can grant CronJobs unintended access to secrets, configmaps, or other sensitive Kubernetes objects.

3. **Resource Exhaustion:**
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Malicious CronJobs can consume excessive CPU, memory, or network resources, leading to denial-of-service conditions for other applications running in the cluster.
    * **Cryptojacking:** Attackers can deploy CronJobs designed to mine cryptocurrencies, utilizing cluster resources for their own financial gain.

4. **Data Exfiltration:**
    * **Sensitive Data Access:** If CronJobs have access to sensitive data (e.g., secrets, databases), attackers can exploit this access to exfiltrate confidential information.
    * **Command Execution:** Attackers might modify CronJob commands to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise.

### Defending

1. **Secure Container Image Management:**
    * **Trusted Registries:** Use only trusted and verified container image registries.
    * **Image Scanning:** Implement image scanning tools to detect vulnerabilities and malicious code in container images before deployment.
    * **Image Signing:** Verify the integrity and authenticity of container images using digital signatures.

2. **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * **RBAC:**  Enforce strong RBAC policies to restrict CronJob permissions to only the necessary resources.
    * **Service Accounts:** Use dedicated service accounts with minimal privileges for CronJobs.
    * **Avoid Root:** Run CronJob containers as non-root users whenever possible.

3. **Resource Limits:**
    * **Resource Quotas:** Set resource quotas to limit the amount of CPU, memory, and storage that CronJobs can consume.
    * **Pod Security Policies:**  Consider using Pod Security Policies (or their replacements in newer Kubernetes versions) to enforce resource limits and security contexts for pods created by CronJobs.

4. **Security Context:**
    * **Restrict Capabilities:**  Limit the capabilities of CronJob containers to reduce their potential attack surface.
    * **Seccomp Profiles:** Implement seccomp profiles to restrict system calls available to CronJob containers.
    * **AppArmor/SELinux:** Utilize AppArmor or SELinux to enforce Mandatory Access Control and confine container processes.

5. **Monitoring and Auditing:**
    * **Monitor CronJob Activity:** Regularly monitor CronJob execution, resource usage, and logs for suspicious activity.
    * **Audit Logs:** Analyze Kubernetes audit logs to detect unauthorized access or modifications related to CronJobs.

6. **Security Best Practices:**
    * **Regular Updates:** Keep Kubernetes, container images, and dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
    * **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Kubernetes cluster and its components to limit the impact of a potential compromise.
    * **Security Training:** Educate developers and administrators about secure CronJob design and deployment practices.

By implementing these defensive strategies, you can significantly reduce the risks associated with Kubernetes CronJobs and enhance the overall security of your cluster.
